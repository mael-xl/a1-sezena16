This is not yet a great website. It is not even in HTML.
Please make it great and also in HTML.
Let's do this.
Football is not only about competing.
The website will be designed for showing the main idea of football.
Football is a sport that liked by most of people.
The people enjoy both playing and watching it,especially younger ones.
Football is based on rivalry and competition.
The opponents pit against each other on the field.
The results can be as one of them is winner, or they tie up each other.
As playing football in field, something bad can happen.
For example, footballers fight with each other for a decide which is made by referees,
or swearing mutually.
However, these behaviours are wrong for ethics, 
maybe a kid who love football may watch the matches, and learn some insulting words, 
or maybe learn how to fight, that was a joke.
To prevent these actions can be set some hinderance, that have already been exist. 
As these are not sufficient to prevent them, footballers should be more sensitive against the behaviours.
Some virtues are much more important than rivalry in football
such as giving respect your opponent or making a fan happy by giving jersey or spending time with him/her.
The assets make the sport and every other sports better.
The audiences come to stadium for watching football, not fights, or some disgraceful actions.
If footballers give respect each other, and they work for playing football.
Football will be not only nicer, but also everybody touched in football happier than old.
Therefore, football is not only football.
