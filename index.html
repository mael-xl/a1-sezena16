           In a day when his fate change completely, he went watching Grandoli match,
           which is one of worst teams in his town, with his grandma.

           but there is no one is there for playing a match. 
           Then Leo's grandma yelled to coach to say that Leo is good enough to play.
           The coach looked Leo carefully, and he said that he is too small to play with those kids.
           He said so, since the other boys are elder and stronger in terms of physicality than Leo.
           On the other side Leo insisted to play. Since the coach had not much time, he had to agree that.
           Grandma said Leo that <em>You will be the best.</em>
           He gave Leo a jersey, and then is history.
           He looked like a dwarf between them but his ability, his charm was so fascinating.
           This was the inception of his astounding accomplishments,
           and the first one is more significant than others, because <em>he was 5 while he has done these.</em>
           However, he startled everyone who watched that match from stand and bench with his style of playing.
           Then he started to play where his football adventure has begun, in Grandoli.
